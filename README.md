# STM32-projects

  This repository consist my STM32 projects for the STM32F407 Discovery card. These projects created at my journey of learning how to code to an embedded system and how to use the features of STM32 chips. All of these projects are created with STM32Cube MX and coded with Arm Keil uVision 5.
